- this repo has only 1 short but fun fun function that when called show a random Pearls Before Swine comic.  

### ideas  

- website actually has more comics, maybe add that as fun arg.

- rename fun to something short and more useful e.g. every now and then when working and starting to get tired - type in `comic()` to get some random comic in viewer pane.  

- check out that xkcd pkg for the tests

- maybe make a pkg as well (check before if smth similar exists?)
